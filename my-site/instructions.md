# Banananano - Shadcn/UI Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented shadcn/ui components throughout the Banananano application, replacing all custom UI elements with best-in-class, accessible components.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Dependencies

- ✅ **shadcn/ui** - Complete component library setup
- ✅ **lucide-react** - Icon library for consistent iconography
- ✅ **class-variance-authority** - Component variant management
- ✅ **clsx & tailwind-merge** - Utility functions for styling

### Shadcn Components Added

- **Button** - All interactive elements now use consistent button variants
- **Input** - Form inputs with proper styling and accessibility
- **Card** - Container components for content organization
- **Sheet** - Slide-out navigation panel (replaces custom sidebar)
- **Label** - Accessible form labels
- **Form** - Form management (ready for future expansion)
- **Badge** - Status indicators and metadata display

### Updated Components

#### 1. AppShell (`src/components/AppShell.tsx`)

- **Before**: Custom sidebar with manual positioning and click-outside logic
- **After**: Clean Sheet component with proper accessibility
- **Improvements**:
  - Proper ARIA attributes
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Consistent spacing and typography
  - Icon integration with lucide-react

#### 2. LoginForm (`src/app/account/login/LoginForm.tsx`)

- **After**: Professional card-based form with shadcn components
- **Improvements**:
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Loading states with spinner
  - Error state styling
  - Proper form validation feedback
  - Card layout for better visual hierarchy

#### 3. Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Simple form and list layout
- **After**: Card-based layout with proper typography
- **Improvements**:
  - Card components for content sections
  - Icon integration
  - Better visual hierarchy
  - Consistent spacing and colors

#### 4. Project Page (`src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Basic layout with minimal styling
- **After**: Professional card-based layout
- **Improvements**:
  - Card containers for header and content
  - Badge component for metadata
  - Icon integration
  - Better visual separation

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Minimal and Elegant

- Clean component interfaces
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's design tokens
- Proper visual hierarchy
- Subtle shadows and borders

### 2. Best Practices for Developer Experience

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper JSX.Element types
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Proper React patterns, memoization-ready components
- **Maintainability**: Modular component structure, consistent naming

### 3. Consistent Theming

- Uses shadcn's design system with CSS custom properties
- Dark/light mode ready (CSS variables in place)
- Consistent color palette and typography
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration

- **shadcn config**: `components.json` with New York style
- **Tailwind**: Integrated with shadcn's CSS variables
- **Icons**: Lucide React with consistent sizing and styling

### Component Architecture

- **Composition**: Components use React composition patterns
- **Variants**: Button and other components support multiple variants
- **Accessibility**: All components include proper ARIA attributes
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout

### File Structure

```
src/components/ui/          # shadcn components
├── button.tsx
├── input.tsx
├── card.tsx
├── sheet.tsx
├── label.tsx
├── form.tsx
└── badge.tsx
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All UI elements now follow the same design language
2. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA support and keyboard navigation
3. **Maintainability**: Modular components that are easy to update
4. **Developer Experience**: Type-safe, well-documented components
5. **Performance**: Optimized React components with proper patterns
6. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend and customize components

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Add more shadcn components as needed (Dialog, Toast, etc.)
- Implement dark mode toggle
- Add more interactive components (Dropdown, Select, etc.)
- Create custom component variants for brand-specific styling

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Type checking
yarn typecheck

# Linting
yarn lint
```

All components are now production-ready with best-in-class UX and developer experience.

## Canvas Layers and Screenshot

### Layered Drawing System

- Layers: Each canvas now contains an ordered list of layers `{ id, name, visible, strokes[] }`.
- Active layer: Only the active layer receives draw/erase interactions; hidden layers are not drawn nor captured in screenshots.
- Strokes: Each stroke is a polyline with `{ points: number[], color: string, size: number, erase: boolean }`.
- State management: A reducer manages actions for adding/removing/selecting layers, toggling visibility, renaming, clearing, and adding strokes to the active layer.

### Persistence

- Serialization: Canvas data is saved as `{ layers: Layer[] }` to `Project.data`.
- Legacy support: If legacy JSON is an array of strokes, it is loaded as a single visible layer named "Layer 1".

### Screenshot (Composite)

- Function: `getCanvasScreenshot(layers, width, height)` composes visible layers into a single PNG data URL, honoring transparency and brush/erase operations.
- UI: A "Screenshot" button stores the latest composite image in memory and previews it beneath the layer controls.

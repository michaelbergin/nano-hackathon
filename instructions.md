# Nano Hackathon Project - Screenshot System Fix

## Recent Updates (January 2025)

### Screenshot System Fix

Fixed the project thumbnail system to ensure screenshots update properly in the projects list.

#### Problem Identified:

The screenshot system was not updating thumbnails properly due to several issues:

1. **Cloudinary Version Locking**: URLs included version parameters (e.g., `/v1757223327/`) that were cached by browsers
2. **Ineffective Cache Invalidation**: Even with `overwrite: true` and `invalidate: 1` flags, the version number didn't change
3. **Cache-Busting Failure**: Query parameters (`?t=timestamp`) were ineffective due to static Cloudinary versions
4. **Stale Thumbnails**: Projects list showed outdated thumbnails even after new screenshots were taken

#### Solution Implemented:

1. **Unique Public IDs**:

   - Changed from static `projects/${projectId}/thumbnail`
   - To timestamp-based `projects/${projectId}/thumbnail_${timestamp}`
   - Each screenshot gets a unique identifier

2. **Version-less URLs**:

   - Remove version parameters from Cloudinary URLs before storing
   - Using regex: `json.secure_url.replace(/\/v\d+\//, "/")`
   - Enables proper cache invalidation

3. **Enhanced Cache Control**:

   - Added Cloudinary transformation parameters: `w=400&q=auto&f=auto`
   - Optimized delivery and automatic format selection
   - Proper cache-busting with timestamp query parameter

4. **Cross-Origin Support**:
   - Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute
   - Enables proper CORS handling for images

#### Technical Changes:

**ProjectCanvas.tsx**:

- Modified screenshot upload to use timestamp-based public IDs
- Removed Cloudinary version from URLs before database storage
- Updated both automatic (5-minute timer) and manual (button-triggered) uploads
- Changed from `overwrite: true` to `overwrite: false` for unique IDs

**ProjectsPage.tsx**:

- Enhanced image tags with transformation parameters
- Added cross-origin support for proper loading
- Maintained cache-busting with updatedAt timestamp

#### Result:

Project thumbnails now update immediately when new screenshots are taken, providing users with accurate visual representations of their current work. The system properly handles:

- Manual screenshots via the Screenshot button
- Automatic screenshots during content generation
- Periodic background screenshots (every 5 minutes)

## Previous Work Context

This project is a continuation of the Banananano application with shadcn/ui implementation and various fixes applied.

## Multiplayer Plan (Loro) — September 2025

- A comprehensive plan for adding real-time multi-user editing using Loro CRDTs (doc sync, presence, undo/redo, and snapshot persistence) has been authored.
- See `@multiplayerInstructions.md` at the repository root for the detailed design, data model, transport, persistence, rollout phases, and acceptance criteria.

## User Management (Superadmin-only)

- Requirements for a new superadmin-only user management page are documented.
- It adds a `/admin/users` page to list users, show usage metrics (projects, generations), and change `plan` (trial ↔ subscribed); guarded by server-side role checks and linked from the avatar menu only for superadmins.
- See `@userManagementInstructions.md` at the repository root for full specification and migration notes.
